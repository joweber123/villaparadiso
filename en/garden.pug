      h2 Relax, Recover, Enjoy
      p If you want to relax, feel free to spend your time in the garden and on its terraces. You may also like cooling off in the small pool or playing a fun game of bowls. In the evening, admire the starry sky and the Cap di Mele illuminated by a thousand lights with a bottle of good wine.
